# Hi, I'm Ektoras Kalantzis

## ðŸ§­A philosophy of mine

I constantly push myself to explore and share as many ideas and projects as I can, especially in the areas that truly interest me. My main goal is to learn through hands-on experience, and every project I take on is part of that journey.

Hopefully, you'll find something useful or interesting here â€” and even better, if you spot mistakes, have suggestions, or want to collaborate, Iâ€™d truly appreciate your feedback.

* Working a lot with 3D enviroments and 3D creation
